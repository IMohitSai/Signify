Signify: AI-Powered Sign Language to Text Converter âœ‹ðŸ”¤
Signify is a deep learning-powered system that converts text to sign language images, leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate high-quality static gestures. This project aims to bridge the communication gap for the hearing-impaired by creating an AI-driven sign language generator.

Features
âœ… GAN-based Image Generation â€“ Uses DF-GAN, Pix2Pix, and StyleGAN2 for realistic sign language image synthesis.
âœ… Gloss-to-Image Mapping â€“ Converts structured gloss text to corresponding sign images.
âœ… Arduino Integration â€“ Supports gesture-based input/output for real-time applications.
âœ… Custom Dataset Training â€“ Fine-tuned model on diverse sign language datasets.
âœ… Scalable Architecture â€“ Designed for integration into assistive technology and real-time applications.
